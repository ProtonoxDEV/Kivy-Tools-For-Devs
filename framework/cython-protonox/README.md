Protonox Cython bundle
======================

This folder is reserved for the latest stable Cython sources compatible with python-for-android.
Because the workspace cannot fetch external archives, the upstream sources are not vendored yet.
When network access is available, download the preferred stable release, unpack it here, remove
`.git` metadata, and record the release version in `VERSION.txt`.
